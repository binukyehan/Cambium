        <h2>ECOSYSTEM</h2>

        <p>
          With biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components that interact
          with one another and their surroundings, ecosystems are intricate,
          interrelated systems. The size of these ecosystems varies from small
          ecosystems such as ponds or small woods to large ecosystems such as
          oceans or tropical rainforests.<br /><br />
          <b>Key features of ecosystems include:</b><br /><br />
          <b>Biodiversity: </b><br />ecosystems support a wide range of plant,
          animal and microbiological species, and each contributes to the
          maintenance of ecosystem services in its own way.<br />
          <br /><b>Energy flow:</b><br />ecosystems absorb, store, and
          distribute energy, which powers biological processes and supports
          life, through food webs and energy pyramids.<br />
          <b><br />Cycle of nutrient:</b><br />
          nutrients, such as carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus, are taken from the
          environment by plant life that releases them back to the natural world
          or is recycled via decomposition.<br />
          <b><br />Interactions:</b><br />Some of the ways in which organisms
          interact with one another and with their environment are predation,
          competition, and symbiosis. Ecosystems provide a wide range of
          ecological services that are crucial for human well being, including:
          Control of weather and climate The availability of clean water and air
          Creation of soils and nutrient cycling Pollination of natural
          vegetation and plant life Defense against natural disasters, including
          floods and erosion. But ecosystems are under increasing stress from
          human activities like pollution, habitat destruction, deforestation,
          and climate change, endangering their stability and well-being. The
          preservation of ecosystems and the services they offer depends on
          conservation initiatives and sustainable management techniques.

        <h2>BIODIVERSITY</h2>
        <p>
          Biodiversity includes the diversity of life forms on Earth, including
          genetic variations, species differences and environmental
          variability.This is the result of billions of years of evolution, and
          it's necessary to keep ecosystems alive and functioning.
          <br /><br /><b>Genetically diverse:</b><br />
          the diversity of genes found in a species is considered to be
          genetically varied. It allows organisms to fight disease, adapt to
          changes in the environment and evolve as time passes. The likelihood
          of survival and viability in a species is increased by the greater
          diversity of its genes. <br /><br /><b>Species diversity:</b><br />
          This is a term that describes the range and abundance of individual
          species in an area or environment. It's covering everything from giant
          trees to charming megafauna and microscopic microbes. It is frequently
          associated with good ecosystems because of the high diversity of
          species, which provides resilience to ecological changes and
          protection from them. <br /><br /><b>Diversity:</b><br />the range of
          ecosystems in an area or on Earth as a whole is considered to be
          diverse. Some biological communities are supported by diverse
          habitats, such as wetlands, grasslands, forests and corals which
          provide a wide range of ecosystem services. The diversity of
          ecosystems plays an important role in the stability and resilience of
          natural systems, as well as protecting overall biodiversity.
          <br /><br /><b
            >In order to support ecosystem functions and services, biodiversity
            has a key role to play, including:</b
          ><br />
          Control of air quality and climate soil and water purification
          supplying food, medication, and other necessities Pollination of
          natural vegetation and crops Management of illnesses and pests
          Encouragement of artistic and leisure pursuits

          <br /><br />However, human actions like habitat destruction, overuse
          of natural resources, pollution, and climate change are putting
          biodiversity in jeopardy. Protecting and restoring biodiversity as
          well as guaranteeing the long-term survival of species and ecosystems
          depend on conservation activities such as protected areas, habitat
          restoration, sustainable land management, and community-based
          conservation programmes.
