      <p class="introductionP">
        Sri Lanka is the home to both migratory and endemic species. The high
        diversity of ecosystems and biodiversity has provided habitats for
        plethora of wildlife. Many species are facing the threat of extinction
        due to habitat loss,

        and climatic changes. This content page shows the mostly endangered

      <p class="introduction">
        The Asian elephant is the largest mammal living on the land in Asian
        content. According to International Union for Conservation of Nature Red
        List Asian elephant categorized as endangered. Asian elephants provide
        numerous facilities for the ecosystem. They create pathways through the
        forests enabling travel for many species. Asian elephants produce 100
        kilograms of dung daily giving adequate compost for plant diversity and
        food for insects who feed upon elephant dung. Due to human elephant
        conflict Makes them critically endangered.

      <p>
        Blue whale is mammal who acts a critical role in marine ecosystem
        preventing imbalance of the food web making it stable and maintains the
        ocean ecosystem. They play an important role in capturing carbon dioxide
        in the atmosphere, making Carbon dioxide on average. Blue whales fight
        against climatic changes which will guide to critical environmental
        problems if they are extinct. Increasing plastic pollution, human made
        ocean echoes, waste and fuel remove by ships threaten the blue whale
        population.

        It is a small and a nocturnal native in rainforests and scrubs in Sri
        Lanka. The life span of red slender Loris is approximately 15 years. It
        is mostly insectivorous eating insects in fields helping farmers to
        protect the harvest. So, their major benefit to ecosystem is preventing
        population of harmful insects. Also helping the balance of food chain by
        being the prey of snakes and eagles. Thet are endangered with habitat
        loss, pet trade and hunting.

      <p>
        This plant commonly found in mangrove forests, wetlands and coastal
        habitats in Sri Lanka. The extensive root system helps to prevent soil
        erosion, maintaining clean water and supporting ecosystems in mangrove
        habitats. This plant provides food and shelter for small mammals, birds
        and insects. When flooding and natural disasters happen, it has a high
        tolerance to protect land. Different parts of this tree are used for
        medical treatments. Scyphiphora hydrophyllace endangered due to habitat
        loss deforestation and coastal urbanization. It is essential to restore
        natural habitat for Scyphiphora hydrophyllace ensuring its survival for
        the balance of ecosystems.

        black market. Natural disasters such as floods, storms and tsunamis also
        cause destruction for these turtles. Biggest human threats are
