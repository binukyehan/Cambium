        <p>
          Many human activities have affected the current environment we live
          in. In this content page, we are going to explore these activities.
          Even though there are numerous types of human activities that cause
          environmental issues, we will be focusing on some of the main
          activities out of those.

        <div class="deforest-info">
          <img src="images/deforestation1.jpg" alt="image of deforestation" />
          <p>
            Deforestation is the clearing of forests; cutting trees
            intentionally by humans for their own purposes such as agriculture,
            firewood, manufacturing items, fossil fuel etc. This has been
            continued for years and now it has been a major environmental
            disaster in the current world. According to the statistics, in 2010,
            Sri Lanka had around 3..50 Mha of green forests, which is over 54%
            of Sri Lanka's land area. but when it comes to 2022, we have lost
            8.22kha of green forests, which will afftect CO2 emmisions as well.
            Many endangered species like Sri lankan Leopard, are at high risk
            due to losing of their habitats due to deforestion. Since this
            diturbs the environmental balance as well, it will lead the animals
            such as elephants who were in forests to come to human habitats.
            After steeling their homes by deforestation, we can't complain that
            those innocent animals are invading our habitats because humans
            already did it do those animals. And since this deforestation
            affects the water cycle as well, there will be lesser rainfalls and
            the oxygen percentage in the atmosphere will also be affected.

      <div class="pollution">
        <h2 id="pollute">Pollution</h2>
        <div class="pol-info">
          <p>
            The basic definition of pollution can be taken as the introduction
            of harmful materials to the environment. Pollution can take place in
            various forms, it can be land pollution, water pollution, air
            pollution or noise pollution. All this forms are mainly due to human
            activities. Because of these irresponsible human activities, not
            only the environment, but humans are also suffering. Recently in Sri
            lanka the Air quality of urban areas has been noticed as very poor
            and toxic. According to the WHO, the air quality average of sri
            lanka is 3 times higher than the annual air quality guidline. Even
            though we are still not the worst, we are going up the chart of
            worst air quality countries, currently sitting at 49th postition.
            One of the main activities people do that mainly affects land
            pollution and water pollution is the disposing of garbage; waste
            matter in an irresponsible manner. Some dispose their waste matter
            into water bodies leading to water pollution in those areas. These
            will affect the aqauatic eco system too. In Sri Lanka there is an
            Environmental Pollution Control Unit that has been established by
            the government, but still the pollution is increasing day by day. In
            roads of sri lanka people more often tends to use their vehicle
            horns unnecessaraly, this will lead to noise pollution mainly in
            urban areas like Colombo. Due to the pollution, various diseases has
            stared to spread too. Due to consumption of poluted water people are
            having kidney related diseases, and due to inhaling of polluted air,
            the lung diseases rate has gone high.

        </div>
        <p id="afterpol">
          Since all these are due to the irresponsible actions done by human, we
          should be more responsible when we are doing our day to day activites.
          Otherwise there will be no trees; no clean air; no clear water bodies
          for the future generations.

        <div class="over-info">
          <img
            src="images/overconsumption1.jpg"
            alt="an image of overconsumption of resources." />
          <p>
            According to the International Resource panal, the global resource
            consumption has been tripled since 1970. Overconsumption of
            resources can be diefined as the use of natural resource, that
            cannot sustain themselves at the rate of humans consuming those
            resources. So due to this excessive resouce extraction, biodiversity
            will be lost and the natural ecosystems will be unbalanced.
            Deforestaion can also be taken as a result of overconsumption; over
            use of wood for human purposes. For this non-renewable resources to
            exsist, we need to give them time to regrow. Well not only trees,
            the current fish population is also at risk due to overfishing.
            Internationally, 34% of fish populations are being overfished. If
            this continues, this will result in the total fish polulation of a
            some type of fish. The two most used natural resources are water and
            sand. Even though sand doesn't seem like one of the most used ones,
            it is heavily used in construction industry for mixing concrete.
            Each year, around 50 million tons of sand is being extracted. This
            will lead to consequeces such as deterioration of water bodies since
            sand is removed in large quantities. In Sri lanka too we heard
            cuuting of trees near Sinheraja forests which is a result of
            overcutting of trees for human purposes.

      <div class="urbanization">
        <h2 id="urbanize">Urbanization</h2>
        <img src="images/urbanization1.jpg" alt="an image of urbanization." />
        <p>
          Urbanization can be simply defined as the transformation of unoccupied
          and unpopulated areas into highly populated areas. Due to the increase
          of human population, people will have to make buildings and other
          constructions to make their habitat more comfortable. But for this
          process most the time, large areas of forests are cleared resulting
          deforestation. And this will leaad to the loss of habitats for lots of
          other animals as well. Eventualling leading to conflicts betweet
          humans and those animals, in Sri lanka, the Wild Elephant-Human
          conflict can be taken as an example for this situation. And due to
          urbanization the pollution of air is also increased in that area since
          there will be industrial waste, burning of fossil fuels and other
          emmisions. And since the habitat is created by humans and is being
          highly populated, the risk of spreadind diseases is really high. And
          since there will be less trees, the temperatures in those areas will
          also rise which will affect not only the humans but other animals in
          the environment and the remaining plants; trees as well. In most of
          the countries the water quality of water bodies has been drastically
          decreased due to the issues that come up with urbanization. So these
          problems created by humans has affected the mother nature and future
          generations of humans as well.
